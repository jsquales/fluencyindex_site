  <h2>How Fluency Index will work</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Students complete a short, timed check-in</strong> designed for fairness, not speed races.</li>
    <li><strong>We calculate a fluency score</strong> on a 650–850 scale aligned with instructional bands.</li>
    <li><strong>Teachers and families see clear strengths and next steps</strong> by table and skill type.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="coming-soon">This platform is in early development. If you’d like to pilot Fluency Index with your school or class, please use the “Request Early Access” button above.</p>
